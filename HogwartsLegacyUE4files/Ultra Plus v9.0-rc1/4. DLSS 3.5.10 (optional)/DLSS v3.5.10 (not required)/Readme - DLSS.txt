Included is DLSS 3.1.13, which has performance and stability updates.

If you're running the June version of the game, this ships with DLSS v3.1.2 which is fine. You can update it if you like, however. Copy it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hogwarts Legacy\Engine\Plugins\Runtime\Nvidia\DLSS\Binaries\ThirdParty\Win64.

If you're running the Feb or March version of the game, please update DLSS for the best performance.


Note: In the May game version, updating DLSS might not work correctly.
