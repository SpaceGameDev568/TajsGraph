There are problems with how DLSS handles raytraced reflections, and a few other things in the game. (These issues don't occur with DLAA.)

The most noticable problem, is "door crawling" ... Where you see a door texture kind of moving horizontally across the screen. That's a problem with DLSS.

To fix this, you can use a different DLSS profile. The game uses profile "C" by default, which is designed for high FPS (twitch) games.

The included file will change the profile to "D", which is designed for image stability. Either "D" or "F" profiles work well.

An argument could be made for using any of C, D, or F. But in my experience, D or F work best. In general, the higher the letter (i.e. "F"), the newer / more advanced the profile.


To install DLSS Tweaks:
1. Download the mod from https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/550
2. Go to your C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hogwarts Legacy\Phoenix\Binaries\Win64 folder (or GoG folder)
3. Copy nvngx.dll here from DLSSTweaks
4. Copy the dlsstweaks.ini I've provided here as well
5. That's it! Enjoy a more stable image! üòä
